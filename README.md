A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Installation: 

First of all, developer should install and setup Flutter on https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install. (We recommend manual download instead of VS Code install.)

Developer needs an IDE for developing this project. (Usually Android Studio or VS Code for this project.)

Developer should download Android Studio for Mobile Emulator and connect it to VSCode if developer wants code this on VSCode. https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=tr

Developer have to import fs,cors,express and jwt modules with using "npm init jw,fs,cors,express" on terminal.

And finally, developer should run "flutter pub get" on terminal for import necessary flutter modules.
